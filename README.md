## About the Challenge

In this challenge, we will develop a meal registration application that includes the following features:

- Add a new meal
- Edit a meal
- Remove a meal from the list
- Display diet progress statistics
- Navigate between screens in a stack
- Local storage of meals

Despite having only a few features, we will be using concepts such as:

- States
- State immutability
- Lists and keys in React Native
- Properties
- Componentization
- Navigation parameters
